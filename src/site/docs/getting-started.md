# Getting Started

Welcome to the Curiosity Garden! This guide will help you navigate and make the most of this resource for exploring ideas, tracking learning, and building knowledge.

## What is This?

This is a **digital garden** - a curated collection of interconnected notes about learning, ideas, and personal knowledge. Unlike a blog with chronological posts, a digital garden grows organically with interlinked ideas that evolve over time.

The Curiosity Garden is designed for:
- **Exploring ideas** across any domain
- **Tracking skills** you want to develop
- **Capturing insights** and aha moments
- **Building connections** between concepts

## Navigation

### Using the File Tree

The left sidebar shows the content structure:

- **entities/** - Core knowledge organized by type
  - **concept/** - Core ideas and mental models
  - **course/** - Learning journeys and curricula
  - **skill/** - Abilities to develop
  - **resource/** - Books, articles, materials
  - **question/** - Open inquiries
  - **insight/** - Aha moments and realizations

### Using Search

Click the search icon or press `/` to search across all content:

- Search by title, content, or tags
- Filter by entity type
- Click results to navigate

### Using the Knowledge Graph

The interactive graph shows how concepts connect:

- **Nodes** = Individual notes
- **Lines** = Relationships between notes
- **Colors** = Entity types (see below)
- Click any node to navigate to that note
- Hover for preview

## Understanding Entity Types

Content is organized by learning-focused entity types:

| Type | Icon | Color | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| Concept | 💡 | Blue | Core ideas and mental models |
| Course | 🎓 | Orange | Learning journeys and curricula |
| Skill | 🎯 | Yellow | Abilities to develop |
| Resource | 📚 | Green | Books, articles, materials |
| Question | ❓ | Purple | Open inquiries |
| Insight | ✨ | Pink | Aha moments and realizations |

## Reading Notes

Each note contains:

1. **Title & Badge** - Name and entity type
2. **Description** - Brief summary
3. **Main Content** - Detailed information
4. **Related Entities** - Connected concepts
5. **Backlinks** - Other notes linking here
6. **Tags** - Topic labels

## Tips for Exploration

1. **Follow links** - Click `[[linked terms]]` to explore connections
2. **Use backlinks** - See what connects to this topic
3. **Explore the graph** - Find unexpected relationships
4. **Search broadly** - Try different terms
5. **Check tags** - Find related content

## Contributing

This garden is maintained through Obsidian. If you have access:

1. Add notes to the appropriate entity folder
2. Include `dg-publish: true` in frontmatter
3. Set the `dg-entity-type` field
4. Link related concepts with `[[wiki links]]`
5. Publish via the Digital Garden plugin

## Example Workflow

Here's how you might use the Curiosity Garden:

1. **Start with a Question** - "How does spaced repetition work?"
2. **Find Resources** - Books, articles, videos about the topic
3. **Extract Concepts** - Core ideas like "forgetting curve", "active recall"
4. **Develop Skills** - Practice using spaced repetition tools
5. **Capture Insights** - Personal realizations and applications
6. **Track Courses** - Structured learning paths

## Color Quick Reference

| Color | Type | Think of it as... |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Blue | Concept | The "what" to understand |
| Orange | Course | The "path" to follow |
| Yellow | Skill | The "doing" to practice |
| Green | Resource | The "material" to study |
| Purple | Question | The "why" to explore |
| Pink | Insight | The "aha" to remember |
