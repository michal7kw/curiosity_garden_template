# CS50 Introduction to Computer Science

## Overview

CS50 is Harvard's legendary introduction to computer science, taught by Professor David Malan. Known for its engaging lectures and rigorous problem sets, it covers computational thinking, algorithms, data structures, and web development. The course starts with C to teach low-level concepts, then moves to Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently
2. Understand abstraction, data structures, and encapsulation
3. Program in multiple languages (C, Python, SQL, JavaScript)
4. Build web applications from scratch
5. Apply [[First Principles Thinking]] to programming challenges

## Course Structure

### Week 0: Scratch
- Visual programming with MIT Scratch
- Introduction to computational thinking

### Week 1-5: C
- Variables, loops, conditionals
- Arrays, functions, debugging
- Memory, pointers, data structures

### Week 6: Python
- [[Python Programming]] fundamentals
- Transitioning from C to Python

### Week 7-8: SQL & Web
- Database design
- HTML, CSS, Flask

### Week 9-10: Final Project
- Building a complete application

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience required
- Strong problem-solving mindset helpful
- Time commitment is significant (10-20 hours/week)

## Skills You'll Gain

- [[Python Programming]]
- [[Technical Writing]] (for documentation)
- Algorithmic thinking
- Debugging skills

## Key Concepts Covered

- [[First Principles Thinking]] - Understanding how computers actually work
- Abstraction and modularity
- Time and space complexity
- Memory management

## My Notes

### Key Takeaways

- Starting with C teaches you what's actually happening under the hood
- The "less comfortable" and "more comfortable" problem sets cater to different skill levels
- The final project is incredibly rewarding—you build something real
- Duck debugging is a real technique! (Related: [[The Feynman Technique]])

### Questions That Arose

- How do different programming paradigms compare?
- What's the optimal way to practice algorithms?

### Action Items

- [x] Complete Problem Set 0 (Scratch)
- [ ] Work through C problems sets (1-5)
- [ ] Build final project combining [[Python Programming]] and SQL

## Review

**What I liked:**
David Malan's teaching is unparalleled. The production quality is outstanding, and the community (Discord, subreddit) is incredibly supportive.

**What could be improved:**
The jump from C to Python can feel sudden. More gradual transitions between languages would help.

**Would I recommend it?**
100%. This is the gold standard for intro CS courses. Challenging but transformative.
