# What Is The Optimal Learning Schedule?

## The Question

How should I structure my learning time for maximum skill acquisition? What's the optimal balance of focused learning, practice, review, and rest?

## Context

With limited time and energy, scheduling is crucial. This question combines insights from [[entities/course/Learning How to Learn\|Learning How to Learn]], [[entities/resource/Deep Work\|Deep Work]], and [[entities/concept/Spaced Repetition\|Spaced Repetition]] into a practical daily system. It's particularly relevant for complex skills like [[entities/skill/Python Programming\|Python Programming]] that require both conceptual understanding and practical application.

## Current Understanding

Several principles seem to guide optimal scheduling:

1. **Spaced practice beats massed practice**: Shorter sessions spread over time outperform long cram sessions
2. **Sleep is non-negotiable**: [[entities/question/How Does Sleep Affect Learning\|How Does Sleep Affect Learning]] shows sleep is essential for consolidation
3. **Interleaving helps**: Mixing different topics/skills in a session improves long-term retention
4. **Deep work has limits**: Most people can sustain 4-6 hours of deep cognitive work per day
5. **Rest is productive**: Diffuse mode thinking during rest helps solve problems

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Morning is best for new/hard material
- **Description**: Cognitive resources are highest in the morning, making it ideal for challenging new content
- **Evidence for**: Research on circadian rhythms; [[entities/resource/Deep Work\|Deep Work]] recommends morning focus
- **Evidence against**: Individual chronotypes vary; night owls may differ

### Hypothesis 2: Optimal session length is 25-90 minutes
- **Description**: Shorter than 25 min doesn't allow deep engagement; longer than 90 min leads to diminishing returns
- **Evidence for**: Pomodoro technique; ultradian rhythms research
- **Evidence against**: Some tasks benefit from longer uninterrupted blocks

### Hypothesis 3: Review should happen at consistent daily times
- **Description**: [[entities/concept/Spaced Repetition\|Spaced Repetition]] works best as a regular habit, not sporadic practice
- **Evidence for**: [[entities/resource/Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]] on habit formation; [[entities/resource/Anki\|Anki]] best practices
- **Evidence against**: Flexibility might be needed for varied schedules

## Current Best Answer

Based on exploration, here's my current optimal learning schedule framework:

### Daily Structure
1. **Morning Deep Work Block (2-3 hours)**
   - New material, challenging concepts
   - [[entities/concept/The Feynman Technique\|The Feynman Technique]] for understanding
   - No interruptions, phone away

2. **Midday [[entities/resource/Anki\|Anki]] Review (20-30 min)**
   - [[entities/concept/Spaced Repetition\|Spaced Repetition]] review session
   - Maintains previous learning

3. **Afternoon Practice Session (1-2 hours)**
   - Apply learning through projects
   - [[entities/skill/Python Programming\|Python Programming]] coding practice
   - Interleave different skills

4. **Evening Light Review (15-30 min)**
   - Preview tomorrow's material
   - Reflect on day's learning
   - Material consolidates during [[entities/question/How Does Sleep Affect Learning\|sleep]]

### Weekly Structure
- **Focused days** (4-5): Primary skill development
- **Interleaving days** (1-2): Review multiple topics
- **Rest day** (1): Full cognitive rest, allow diffuse processing

### Key Principles
- Never skip [[entities/resource/Anki\|Anki]] reviews
- Protect morning deep work time
- Sleep 7-9 hours consistently
- Track and adjust based on results

## Remaining Uncertainties

- Optimal ratio of new learning to practice/review
- How to adapt schedule when energy is low
- Best way to handle unavoidable schedule disruptions
- Individual variation in optimal rhythms

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement proposed schedule for 4 weeks
- [ ] Track retention, productivity, and energy levels
- [ ] Adjust based on data
- [ ] Research chronotype assessment for personal optimization
- [ ] Explore time-blocking tools for consistency
