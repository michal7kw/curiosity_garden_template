# Python Programming

## Overview

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readable syntax and extensive ecosystem. It's used in web development, data science, automation, AI/ML, and more. Learning Python opens doors to countless applications and career opportunities.

## Proficiency Levels

### Novice
- Can write basic scripts with variables, loops, and functions
- Understands data types and control flow
- Uses the REPL and basic debugging

### Competent
- Can build complete applications with modules
- Handles files, exceptions, and external libraries
- Understands OOP and can write classes
- Uses virtual environments and pip

### Proficient
- Writes Pythonic, idiomatic code
- Understands generators, decorators, and context managers
- Can optimize performance and profile code
- Contributes to open-source projects

### Expert
- Deep understanding of Python internals (CPython, GIL)
- Creates libraries used by others
- Can mentor and teach effectively
- Innovates with advanced patterns and metaprogramming

## Current Assessment

**My current level:** Competent
