# Speed Reading

## Overview

Speed reading is a collection of techniques to increase reading speed without sacrificing comprehension. While the average person reads 200-300 words per minute (wpm), speed readers can reach 500-800+ wpm. The key is eliminating bad habits like subvocalization while building better eye movement patterns.

## Proficiency Levels

### Novice
- Reads at 200-300 wpm
- Aware of subvocalization and regression
- Beginning to practice pointer techniques

### Competent
- Reads at 400-500 wpm
- Minimal subvocalization for easy material
- Uses preview and chunking strategies
- Adjusts speed based on material difficulty

### Proficient
- Reads at 600-800 wpm
- Can skim effectively for key information
- Strong metacognitive awareness of comprehension
- Teaches others basic techniques

### Expert
- 1000+ wpm with good comprehension
- Pioneering new techniques
- Published research or recognized authority

## Current Assessment

**My current level:** Novice

**Evidence:**
- Currently reading around 250 wpm
- Heavy subvocalization habit
- Starting to practice with a pointer

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations
- [ ] Take baseline reading speed test
- [ ] Practice pointer technique for 20 min/day
- [ ] Work on reducing subvocalization

### Phase 2: Practice
- [ ] Read one book using speed reading techniques
- [ ] Practice with different material types
- [ ] Track progress weekly

### Phase 3: Mastery
- [ ] Integrate speed reading into daily workflow
- [ ] Balance speed vs. comprehension for different materials
- [ ] Teach techniques to others

## Resources for Learning

### Courses
- [[Learning How to Learn]] - Context on how reading fits into learning
- "Become a SuperLearner" on Udemy

### Books/Articles
- [[Deep Work]] - Using focused practice for skill development
- "Breakthrough Rapid Reading" by Peter Kump
- "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler

### Practice Platforms
- Spreeder (online tool)
- Readlax app
- Daily newspaper/article practice

## Related Skills

- [[Technical Writing]] - Understanding good writing improves reading speed
- Active recall and note-taking
- Focus and attention management

## Practice Log

| Date | Activity | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 2026-01-31 | Baseline test | 10 min | 250 wpm, 80% comprehension |
| 2026-01-31 | Pointer practice | 20 min | Felt awkward but faster |

## Milestones

- [x] Establish baseline reading speed
- [ ] Reach 400 wpm with 70%+ comprehension
- [ ] Read a full book using speed reading
- [ ] Reach 600 wpm on familiar material

## Key Considerations

- **Comprehension vs. speed tradeoff**: Not everything should be speed-read. [[Deep Work]] requires slower, focused reading.
- **Material matters**: Technical material like [[Python Programming]] documentation may need slower reading.
- **Use [[Spaced Repetition]]**: Speed reading works well for intake, but use [[Anki]] for retention.
