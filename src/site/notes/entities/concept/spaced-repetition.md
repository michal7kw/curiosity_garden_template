# Spaced Repetition

## Overview

Spaced Repetition is a learning technique that schedules review sessions at optimal intervals to combat the forgetting curve. By reviewing information just before you're about to forget it, you strengthen memory with minimal effort and maximum retention.

## Key Principles

1. **The Forgetting Curve**: Without review, we forget approximately 70% of new information within 24 hours (Ebbinghaus, 1885)
2. **Optimal spacing**: Review intervals increase exponentially (e.g., 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)
3. **Active recall**: Testing yourself is more effective than passive re-reading

## Examples

- **Medical students**: Using flashcard systems to memorize thousands of terms and drug interactions
- **Language learning**: Learning vocabulary with apps like Duolingo that incorporate spaced repetition
- **Programming**: Remembering syntax, algorithms, and API patterns

## Mental Models

- **Compound interest for memory**: Small, consistent investments in review yield exponential knowledge growth
- **Strengthening neural pathways**: Each review reinforces the memory trace in your brain
- **[[Learning Is About Connections]]**: Spaced repetition works best when facts connect to existing knowledge

## Common Misconceptions

- **It's not just for facts**: Can be used for concepts, procedures, and understanding too
- **Requires consistency**: Skipping reviews undermines the entire system
- **Not a replacement for understanding**: Works best combined with [[The Feynman Technique]]

## Applications

- Medical and legal study (high-volume memorization)
- Learning new languages
- [[Python Programming]] syntax and standard library
- Any skill requiring factual recall
