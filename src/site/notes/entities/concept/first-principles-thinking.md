# First Principles Thinking

## Overview

First Principles Thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking down complex problems into their most fundamental truths and reasoning up from there. Rather than relying on analogies or conventions, you question every assumption and build your understanding from the ground up.

## Key Principles

1. **Question assumptions**: Don't accept conventional wisdom without scrutiny. Ask "Why?" repeatedly until you reach fundamental truths.
2. **Break down complexity**: Decompose problems into their most basic elements that cannot be reduced further.
3. **Reason upward**: Build solutions from the fundamental elements, creating novel approaches unconstrained by existing frameworks.

## Examples

- **Elon Musk and SpaceX**: Instead of accepting that rockets are expensive, Musk asked what rockets are made of (aluminum, titanium, copper, etc.) and their raw material costs, then figured out how to build them more efficiently.
- **Scientific method**: Physics starts from fundamental laws rather than analogy to solve problems.
- **Children's learning**: Kids naturally use first principles—asking "why?" until they understand something fundamentally.

## Mental Models

First principles thinking connects to:
- **Socratic questioning**: The method of asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking
- **Reductionism**: Breaking complex systems into simpler parts
- **[[The Feynman Technique]]**: Understanding through fundamental explanation

## Common Misconceptions

- **It's not always practical**: First principles thinking is time-consuming and not needed for routine decisions
- **Not about ignoring expertise**: You still learn from others, but verify their reasoning
- **Doesn't mean starting from scratch**: It's about understanding foundations, not reinventing everything

## Applications

- **Engineering and design**: Creating innovative solutions by questioning existing designs
- **Business strategy**: Finding new market opportunities by questioning industry assumptions
- **[[Python Programming]]**: Understanding language fundamentals rather than just copying code
- **[[CS50 Introduction to Computer Science]]**: Building computer science knowledge from first principles
