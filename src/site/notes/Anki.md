# Anki

## Overview

Anki is a free, open-source flashcard program that uses [[Spaced Repetition]] to optimize memory retention. Unlike simple flashcard apps, Anki schedules reviews based on how well you know each card—showing difficult cards more often and easy cards less frequently. It's the gold standard tool for anyone serious about long-term memorization.

## Key Information

- **Type:** Software Tool
- **Author:** Damien Elmes
- **First Released:** 2006
- **Platforms:** Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Web
- **Cost:** Free (iOS app paid, but AnkiDroid free)

## Why This Resource?

Anki implements [[Spaced Repetition]] algorithms that have been refined over decades of cognitive science research. It's used by medical students, language learners, and anyone who needs to memorize large amounts of information efficiently.

## Main Topics

1. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**: SM-2 based scheduling that optimizes review timing
2. **Card Types**: Basic, cloze deletion, image occlusion, and custom types
3. **Deck Organization**: Hierarchical organization of flashcard decks
4. **Sync**: Cloud sync across all devices
5. **Add-ons**: Extensive plugin ecosystem for customization

## Related Concepts

- [[Spaced Repetition]] - The core algorithm Anki implements
- [[The Feynman Technique]] - Create cards that test understanding, not just recall
- [[Learning Is About Connections]] - Link cards to create connected knowledge

## Related Skills

- [[Python Programming]] - Memorize syntax, libraries, and patterns
- [[Speed Reading]] - Combine with Anki for reading + retention workflow

## Summary

### Core Message

Make reviewing a daily habit and let the algorithm handle scheduling. Consistency beats intensity.

### Key Arguments/Points

1. **Daily reviews**: 10-30 minutes daily is more effective than occasional cramming
2. **Make good cards**: One fact per card, test understanding not recognition
3. **Active recall**: The act of retrieving information strengthens memory
4. **Low-overhead learning**: Once set up, the system maintains itself

### Notable Features

- **AnkiConnect**: API for integration with other tools
- **Cloze deletions**: Fill-in-the-blank cards for learning in context
- **Image occlusion**: Hide parts of images (anatomy diagrams, etc.)
- **Custom scheduling**: Advanced users can modify the algorithm

## My Notes

### What I Learned

The power of Anki comes from consistency and good card design. Bad cards waste time; good cards feel effortless. The [[Learning How to Learn]] course taught me that cards should test *understanding*, not just surface recognition.

### How It Changed My Thinking

Shifted my approach from "learn and hope to remember" to "learn and systematically maintain." Every important concept I learn now gets a card.

### Questions It Raised

- [[What Is The Optimal Learning Schedule]] - How to balance Anki reviews with new learning?
- Best practices for card creation?

### Action Items

- [x] Set up daily Anki habit (morning routine)
- [x] Create deck for [[Python Programming]] patterns
- [ ] Learn image occlusion for visual material
- [ ] Explore add-ons for efficiency

## Rating & Review

**Overall Rating:** 5/5

**Strengths:**
- Free and open-source
- Cross-platform sync
- Incredibly powerful and customizable
- Large community and shared decks

**Weaknesses:**
- Initial learning curve
- Desktop app interface feels dated
- iOS app is paid (though worth it)

**Who Would Benefit:**
Anyone who needs to remember information long-term: students, language learners, professionals studying for certifications. Essential companion to [[Learning How to Learn]] and [[Spaced Repetition]] concepts.

## Integration with Learning System

1. Learn new material using [[The Feynman Technique]]
2. Create Anki cards for key facts and concepts
3. Apply [[Deep Work]] principles for focused study sessions
4. Use [[Speed Reading]] to consume material, Anki to retain it
5. Schedule reviews per [[What Is The Optimal Learning Schedule]]
