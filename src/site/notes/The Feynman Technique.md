# The Feynman Technique

## Overview

Named after Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, this technique is a powerful method for learning anything deeply. The core idea: if you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it well enough. By teaching a concept as if explaining to a child, you identify gaps in your knowledge and force genuine understanding.

## Key Principles

1. **Choose a concept**: Pick something you want to learn or understand better
2. **Explain it simply**: Write an explanation as if teaching a 12-year-old—no jargon, just simple language
3. **Identify gaps**: Notice where your explanation breaks down or feels unclear
4. **Review and simplify**: Go back to sources, fill gaps, and make your explanation even simpler

## Examples

- **Learning physics**: Feynman famously used simple analogies to explain quantum mechanics
- **Mastering programming**: Explaining how a function works to a rubber duck (rubber duck debugging)
- **Understanding business concepts**: Breaking down complex financial instruments into everyday language

## Mental Models

This technique embodies:
- **[[Teaching Forces Deeper Understanding]]**: The act of explaining consolidates knowledge
- **[[First Principles Thinking]]**: You naturally break down concepts to basics when simplifying
- **Active processing**: Transforms passive knowledge into active understanding

## Common Misconceptions

- **Not about dumbing down**: Simplification requires deeper understanding, not less
- **Works for complex topics**: The harder the concept, the more valuable this technique
- **Not just verbal**: Writing explanations is often even more effective

## Applications

- Preparing for exams or interviews
- [[Technical Writing]]: Writing documentation that others can understand
- Teaching and mentoring others
- Any learning situation where deep understanding matters
