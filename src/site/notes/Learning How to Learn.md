# Learning How to Learn

## Overview

Taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, this course provides practical insights from neuroscience about how our brains learn. With over 3 million learners, it's one of the most popular online courses ever created. It covers techniques for mastering difficult subjects, overcoming procrastination, and retaining information effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Understand how the brain's focused and diffuse thinking modes work
2. Apply [[Spaced Repetition]] and active recall for better memory
3. Overcome procrastination using the Pomodoro Technique
4. Recognize and combat illusions of competence
5. Use chunking to master complex subjects

## Course Structure

### Module 1: What is Learning?
- Focused vs. diffuse modes of thinking
- Procrastination and the Pomodoro Technique
- Introduction to memory systems

### Module 2: Chunking
- How to form and master chunks
- Illusions of competence
- Overlearning and interleaving

### Module 3: Procrastination and Memory
- Tackling procrastination with habits
- Long-term memory and [[How Does Sleep Affect Learning]]
- Creating meaningful memory groups

### Module 4: Renaissance Learning
- Metaphors and analogies in learning
- Changing your thoughts, changing your life
- The value of teamwork and test-taking strategies

## Prerequisites

- None - designed for anyone who wants to learn more effectively
- Helpful: Basic curiosity about how the brain works

## Skills You'll Gain

- [[Speed Reading]]
- Effective note-taking
- Study scheduling
- Procrastination management

## Key Concepts Covered

- [[Spaced Repetition]]
- [[The Feynman Technique]]
- Focused vs. diffuse thinking
- Chunking

## My Notes

### Key Takeaways

- **Focused mode** is like a pinball machine with tight bumpers—great for familiar problems
- **Diffuse mode** has loose bumpers—needed for new concepts and creative solutions
- Sleep is critical for memory consolidation (see [[How Does Sleep Affect Learning]])
- Testing yourself > re-reading material

### Questions That Arose

- [[What Is The Optimal Learning Schedule]]
- [[How Does Sleep Affect Learning]]

### Action Items

- [x] Set up [[Anki]] for spaced repetition
- [ ] Practice Pomodoro Technique for 2 weeks
- [ ] Apply chunking to [[Python Programming]] learning

## Review

**What I liked:**
The course makes neuroscience accessible and immediately applicable. The animations are excellent, and Dr. Oakley's teaching style is engaging.

**What could be improved:**
Some sections feel repetitive. The peer-graded assignments aren't always useful.

**Would I recommend it?**
Absolutely—essential viewing for anyone serious about learning efficiently.
